Welcome to the Redux-based Invoice Management System, a sophisticated project developed with React. This application allows you to effortlessly create invoices by adding itemized items, configuring quantities, prices, tax rates, and discounts. You can also conveniently download your invoices in PDF format directly to your device. The power of this project is harnessed through [jspdf-react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jspdf-react), which captures data from the modal and efficiently converts it from canvas to PDF
